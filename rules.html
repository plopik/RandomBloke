    <h2>How is the Winner Chosen Each Round?</h2>
    <p>
        In each round, both the Player1 and player2 choose how much energy to use. The winner is chosen randomly, but the chance of winning is proportional to the energy spent:
    </p>
<pre>
Let <b>E1</b> = energy used by player 1<br>
Let <b>E2</b> = energy used by player 2<br>
A random number <b>R</b> is chosen between 0 and (A + B).<br>
If R &lt; E1, player 1 wins the point.<br>
Otherwise, player 2 wins the point.
</pre>
    <p>
        This means the probability that player 1 wins is <b>E1 / (E1 + E2)</b>.
